# ParkinsonPredictor
Welcome to Parkinson Predictor, an innovative machine learning-driven platform designed to assist in the early detection of Parkinson's disease. Our web application combines the power of advanced data analysis with a user-friendly interface, making it easier than ever to assess the likelihood of Parkinson's disease in individuals.
our team made this for GFG Hackathon

# How It Works
Parkinson Predictor employs a machine learning algorithm trained on a comprehensive dataset of medical records and symptom assessments. By inputting specific health-related information and symptom details, our application can provide an initial assessment of the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.

# Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our intuitive interface ensures that anyone, regardless of their technical background, can easily use the tool.
- **Predictive Accuracy:** Our machine learning model has been rigorously trained and tested to provide reliable predictions, giving users valuable insights into their health.
- **Privacy and Security:** We prioritize the confidentiality of user data, and our platform complies with stringent security standards to protect sensitive information.

# Contributing to Research
Parkinson Predictor is not just a diagnostic tool but also a valuable resource for ongoing medical research. With user consent, anonymized data collected through our platform can contribute to scientific studies and advancements in Parkinson's disease research.
